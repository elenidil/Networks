Questions on the code/SBM-Distance/wrapper.R
https://github.com/elenidil/Networks/blob/master/Code/SBM-Distance/wrapper.R

wrapper_0
1.	Line 17: loads some test_data.RData (since dataset = “test”) which I don’t have. I only have access to jazz_data and netscience_data 

2.	Line 22: MCMC takes as arguments those function(Y, K, Q, n_sams, n_burn, n_skip, model, dataset, loc) but here is called like this
MCMC(Y, n_sams, n_burn, n_skip, model, dataset, loc).
I have added K=5 and Q=2 like it is in clist_test.R file, but I am not sure if I’m supposed to do that

3.	Line 23: Similar for GOF function, it needs to have THETA in the input arguments.

4.	Line 26: cv_parallel similarly needs as inputs K_range and Q_range which are not given here. I saw somewhere in the code it assigns c(2,4,8) to both of them. 
This function takes a lot of time since inside it has also l=1,…,5. 
This is the output:   save(cv, file = paste0(loc, "outs/", dataset, "/", model, "_K_", K, "_Q_", Q, "_l_", l, "_", dataset, "_", "cv.RData"))

5.	Line 29: the same for test_parallel, where input values K_range and Q_range are missing and instead it has I.
 
6.	Line 32: “get_measures_0” is a function from folder rfunctions.R, starts in line 130. 
Line 149 loads  load(paste0(loc, "outs/", dataset, "/", model, "_l_", l, "_", dataset, "_", "cv.RData")). 
There is no function in the folder that produces that output, the closest one is cv_parallel but the output includes K and Q. 
I was thinking, if it’s possible when calling the cv_parallel function, without defining K and Q somehow it can produce those files, but it doesn’t work.
Line 158: it loads   #load(paste0(loc, "outs/", dataset, "/", model, "_", dataset, "_", "test.RData"))	
some clist_test_test.RData, which should contain ‘stats’ to be used later:
  for (l in 1:n_stats) tab[4+l] <- round(mean(stats[,l] > stats_obs[l], na.rm = T), 6).
The function test_parallel produces this output but contains K and Q.


wrapper_1
1.	Same thing with loading the data
2.	Now MCMC, gof_parallel, cv_parallel and test_parallel takes K_range but not Q_range
3.	Line 63: “get_measures_1”, similarly to get_measures_0 creates a table with names K and Q although Q is not defined. 
Update: This is to be used with class model since it doesn't have Q as input  argument


Wrapper_2 works fine with all the functions

Other questions:
1) When loading the simulated data, for example those from the paper or the ones produced by the function, we cannot use the generate function data
so we don't have the values for U, Xi, Eta, zeta, sigsq before runnning the MCMC, and so we cannot plot those plot_chain(THETA$loglik_chain, ll, main = "Log-likelihood")
2) After I divide the data into test and train how to test the model?
