In NETS.pdf file:

1. Focus on part 6. Class-Distance models for single nets. TODO: Recalculate full conditionals. 
2. Rcpp code. Review and understand code with full conditional notes.



Future extensions:

- Extend for multilayer
- Optimize code. We have a naive version, think about Hamiltonian montecarlo 
and Polya-Gamma latent variables (Polson and Scott, 2013)  
- Variational Bayes?
