Focus on part 6. Class-Distance (or SBM-Distance) model for single nets. 

TODO's: 

1. Check full conditionals. 

2. Check Rcpp code. Review and understand code with full conditional notes.


Near future extension:

- The current model has a Dirichlet-Multinomial prior for the SBM portion of the model. The first step is changing the DM prior for a DP, PY or Gnedin prior.  

- Optimize code. We have a naive version, think about Hamiltonian montecarlo 
and Polya-Gamma latent variables (Polson and Scott, 2013).  



Long term extensions:


- Extend for multilayer networks.

- Variational Bayes?
