Focus on part 6. Class-Distance (or SBM-Distance) model for single nets. 

TODO's: 

1. Check full conditionals. 

2. Check Rcpp code. Review and understand code with full conditional notes.


Near future extension:

- The current model has a Dirichlet-Multinomial prior for the SBM portion of the model. The first step is changing the DM prior for a DP, PY or Gnedin prior.  

- Add shrinkage parameter (e^theta) in the distance term as in Sosa (2020) or Rastelli (2019) 

- Optimize code. We have a naive version, think about noisy-likelihood alternatives Hoff (2012) or Rastelli (2019). Or Hamiltonian Montecarlo and Polya-Gamma latent variables (Polson and Scott, 2013). 
 

Long term extensions:


- Extension to multilayer networks.

- Variational Bayes?
