notes
For the clist model, the cv_parallel function is taking more than 1 hour to give the first result Îš=4,Q=2;l=1, for the rest it took from 6pm until later than 00:00

In clist is not true that the model with the higher AUC has the better performance.

Question: I have run the MCMC function twice for the same K(=5) and Q(=2) and the one time the incidence matrix produced is very close to the true image, while the second time is
all red. Not sure why this happened.
