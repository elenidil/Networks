Advantages of Gnedin prior:
> DM and PY assume an infinite number of non empty clusters. So they lead to inconsisten estimates for the number of communities 
if the data is generated by a model where there are finite non empty clusters. Literature suggests to use Gibbs type priors
with σ >= 0 only when the true number of communities is assumed to grow without bounf with the number of nodes. Gnedin has 
σ < 0 and it assumes a random number of non empty clusters

> simple analytical expression

> The distribution pr(H=h) has the mode at 1, heavy tail and infinite expectation - > Favors simpler models with fewer communities 
while is robust for H due to the heavy tailed prior distribution
